# Android Gradle
There is a difference between build.gradle(Project) and build.gradle(Module). As per my understanding, there are different kind of dependencies:

## build.gradle(Module:app)

  - There is a Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules. You you can observe. But, there is a bit confusing. Android Studio is designed with more view options. If you switch to the *Android* view to *Project* view. You can see the actual stucture and where the different build.gradle files are located. 
  - For example: This is demonstration app: **build.gradle(Project:*design_pattern*)**
  
  - As so each project android will only contain a **top level gradle file**. It usually contains common configs for all modules. Whatever is included in this **top-level gradle**, It will affect all modules.
  - For example: 
  
```java
// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

buildscript {
    
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.1'
        

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```
## build.gradle(Module:app)
  - Build file of your specific module (where you add your **dependencies, signing configs, build types, flavors, etc**. We should observe here:

# Issues:
- Error 1:All flavors must now belong to a named flavor dimension
- Fix 1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44105127/android-studio-3-0-flavor-dimension-issue
```java
android {
    compileSdkVersion 26
    flavorDimensions "default"
```

- Error 2: Add Google Maven reponsitory and sync project

- Fix 2: 
```java
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}
```
